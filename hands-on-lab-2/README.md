# Hands-on lab 2

## Goal
The goal of the second hand-ons excercise is to familiarize ourselves with creating and managing roles, database objects and virtual warehouses.

### Step 1: Getting started
Open a new worksheet. 

### Step 2: Role creation
create the roles of DATA_ENGINEER and DATA_ANALYST with the code down below.

### Step 3: Database-objects 
Next on we will create a example database, schema and table with the following code:

### Step 4: Virtual Warehouses
Now lets create two virtual warehouses, one for the data-analyst and one for the data-engineer:

### Step 5: Granting access
Next on we will grant access to the virtual warehouses created for our data-engineer and data-analyst:

### Step 6: Using the warehouses
If we now select the data engineer role we can use the warehouse we just created, try it yourselves!
